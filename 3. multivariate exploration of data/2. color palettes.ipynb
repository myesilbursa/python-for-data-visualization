    "## Encoding via Color\n",
    "\n",
    "Color is a very common encoding for variables, for both qualitative and quantitative variables. You've already seen this employed in previous lessons where position could not be used to encode a value: color for category in a clustered bar chart, and color for count in a heat map (both as a 2-d histogram and as a 2-d bar chart). Here, we'll look at how to employ color in scatterplots, as well as discuss more about color palette choices depending on the type of data you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a qualitative variable, you can set different colors for different levels of a categorical variable through the \"hue\" parameter on seaborn's [FacetGrid](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.FacetGrid.html) class."

    "\n",
    "For quantitative variables, we should not take the same approach, since **FacetGrid** expects any variable input for subsetting to be categorical. Instead, we can set color based on numeric value in the `scatter` function through the \"c\" parameter, much like how we set up marker sizes through \"s\". (Unlike with size, we don't have an easy way of setting color by numeric value through `regplot` due to how its \"color\" argument is set up.)"

    "For other types of data (ordinal and numeric), a choice may need to be made between a sequential scale and a diverging scale. In a **sequential** palette, consecutive color values should follow each other systematically. Typically, this follows a light-to-dark trend across a single or small range of hues, where light colors indicate low values and dark colors indicate high values. The default sequential color map, \"viridis\", takes the opposite approach, with dark colors indicating low values, and light values indicating high."

One hue indicates values greater than the center point, while the other indicates values smaller than the center."

    "### Selecting Color Palettes\n",

    "If you want to change the color map for your plot, the easiest way of doing so is by using one of the built-ins from Matplotlib or Seaborn. This part of the Matplotlib documentation has a list of strings that can be understood for color mappings. For most of your purposes, stick with the palettes noted in the top few tables as built-in for Matplotlib ('viridis', etc.) or from ColorBrewer; the remaining palettes may not be as perceptually consistent. Seaborn also adds in a number of its own palettes:\n",

    "When using a diverging color palette, you will likely need to specify the \"vmin\" and \"vmax\" parameters in order to have the neutral point in the palette meet the center point in the scale. Alternatively, solutions that create a different normalization function like the one posted in [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20144529/shifted-colorbar-matplotlib) can be used for finer control over the color map. Diverging color scales are common enough for the `heatmap` type that there is a \"center\" parameter for setting the central value. You'll see a demonstration of this later in the lesson (\"Plot Matrices\").\n",

    "### Warnings on Color\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of things to be aware of in general, when working with color. First of all, try and consider color blindness when selecting color for your plots. You don't want your visualization to shut out the 8% of the population that have some kind of color vision deficiency. Fortunately, the built-in color palettes highlighted in the previous section should minimize these concerns. If you use a different, or custom palette, it might be worth checking your visualization's interpretability through a color blindness sim like [this one](http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, you want to be aware of the effect of transparency and overlap on interpretability. If points of different color on a qualitative scale overlap, the result may be a third color that cannot be matched to something in the palette. If multiple points on a quantitative scale overlap, then the result may be a value that does not actually exist in the data. To be safe here, avoid or minimize transparency in plots with color. You may need to plot only a sample of your points in order to make sure that the effect of the third variable is clearly visible."
