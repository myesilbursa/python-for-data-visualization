    "One alternative univariate plot type that you might see for categorical data is the **waffle plot**, also known as the square pie chart. While the standard pie chart uses a circle to represent the whole, a waffle plot is plotted onto a square divided into a 10x10 grid. Each small square in the grid represents one percent of the data, and a number of squares are colored by category to indicate total proportions. Compared to a pie chart, it is much easier to make precise assessments of relative frequencies.\n",

First, we need to create a function to decide how many blocks to allocate to each category. The function below, `percentage_blocks`, uses a rule where each category gets a number of blocks equal to the number of full percentage points it covers. The remaining blocks to get to the full one hundred are assigned to the categories with the largest fractional parts."

To do this, we'll make use of Matplotlib's [`bar`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html) function. We could have used this function earlier in the lesson to create our bar charts instead of Seaborn's `countplot`, but it would have required us to aggregate the data first to get the height of each bar. For the case of the waffle plot, we're going to specify the x- and y- coordinates of the boxes, and set their widths and heights to be equal, to create squares.

As for the [`legend`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html) call, the first argument is a list of categories as obtained from the sorted `waffle_counts` Series variable.

Additional `bar` and [`text`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html) calls have been added to the plot to act as an ad hoc legend.

    "As a further extension, there's no restriction against us using icons for each tally, rather than just squares. Infographics often take this approach, by having each icon represent some number of units (e.g. one person icon representing one million people). But while it can be tempting to use icons to represent values as a bit of visual flair, an icon-based plot contains more chart junk than a bar chart that conveys the same information. Thereâ€™s a larger cognitive challenge in having to count a number of icons to understand the scale of a value, compared to just referencing a box's endpoint on a labeled axis.\n",

    "One other downside of the waffle plot is that it is not commonly supported out of the box for most visualization libraries, including Matplotlib and Seaborn. The length of the demonstration code presented above is a testament to that. The effort required to create a meaningful and useful waffle plot means that it is best employed carefully as a part of explanatory visualizations. During the exploratory phase, you're better off using more traditional plots like the bar chart to more rapidly build your understanding of the data.\n",

The [PyWaffle](https://github.com/gyli/PyWaffle) package can be used with Matplotlib's `figure` function to create waffle plots, with a few options for the orientation and order of icons, but you'll need to install it separately since it's not a major package. One of the main reasons why I didn't use it above is that the syntax for using it is very different from what you've seen and will see in this course. If you want to make use of the library, check out the examples on the linked GitHub page.\n",
