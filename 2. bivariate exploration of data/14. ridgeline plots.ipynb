    "One of the hot new visualization types from recent years is the **ridgeline plot**. In a nutshell, the ridgeline plot is a series of vertically faceted line plots or density curves, but with somewhat overlapping y-axes. This can be thought of as a contrast to the line plot variation seen in the \"Line Plots\" part of the lesson, where multiple lines were plotted on the same axes, with different hues. On this page, I'll walk through the creation of a ridgeline plot using some of the demonstration data shown in the \"Faceting\" page:"

First of all, changing the form of the distribution plots from histograms to kernel density estimates (as seen in the Extras of the previous lesson) will make the overlaps a bit smoother. Second, we need to facet the levels by rows so that they're all stacked up on top of one another."

By setting \"hspec\" to a negative value, the subplot axes bounds will overlap vertically. The \"size\" and \"aspect\" parameters have also been adjusted. While I'm at it, I'll add some code on the `FacetGrid` object to remove the y-axis through the `despine` method and remove the ticks through the `set` method. They're going to start overlapping, and we don't really need them â€“ we're mostly interested in the relative positions of the distributions rather than specific heights.\n",

    "We make clever use of the FacetGrid object's `map` function to perform the plot modifications. Previously, you've seen `map` used where the first argument is a plotting function, the following arguments are positional variable strings, and any additional arguments are keyword arguments for the plotting function. In actuality, you can set any function as the first argument, which will be applied to each facet. To apply the transparency using `map`, I set up an anonymous lambda function that gets the current Axes ([`gca`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.gca.html)), selects its background ([`patch`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.patches.Patch.html)), and sets its transparency to full.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the second `map` argument, it sends a pandas Series to the function specified by the first argument. This Series is filtered to include only the column specified by the second `map` argument, with only the rows appropriate for each facet. In this case, I exploit the fact that the 'many_cat_var' column is filled with copies of the categorical feature string to specify the [`text`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html) string, with hardcoded positional values appropriate to the plot. (`map` also sends a few general keyword arguments like 'color' automatically to the specified function, hence the need for `**kwargs` to capture them despite not specifying any myself.) One downside to this approach is that the x-axis labels get replaced with 'many_cat_var' after the `map` call, thus requiring the addition of a `set_xlabels` function call to reset the string.\n",
