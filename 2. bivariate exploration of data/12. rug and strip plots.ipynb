    "## Rug and Strip Plots\n",

    "You might encounter, or be interested in, marginal distributions that are plotted alongside bivariate plots such as scatterplots. A marginal distribution is simply the univariate distribution of a variable, ignoring the values of any other variable. For quantitative data, histograms or density curves are fine choices for marginal plot, but you might also see the **rug plot** employed. In a rug plot, all of the data points are plotted on a single axis, one tick mark or line for each one. Compared to a marginal histogram, the rug plot suffers somewhat in terms of readability of the distribution, but it is more compact in its representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn's [JointGrid](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.JointGrid.html) class enables this plotting of bivariate relationship with marginal univariate plots for numeric data. The `plot_joint` method specifies a plotting function for the main, joint plot for the two variables, while the `plot_marginals` method specifies the plotting function for the two marginal plots. Here, we make use of seaborn's [`rugplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.rugplot.html) function."

    "The rug plot is fine here since the data isn't particularly numerous or overly dense. In other circumstances, a histogram or density curve will be more appropriate. You probably won't consider the rug plot as a primary plot choice, but it can be a good supporter plot in certain circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another supporting plot type similar to the rug plot is the **strip plot**. It's like a swarm plot (see the previous page) but without any dodging or jittering to keep points separate or off the categorical line. You can also think of it as a rug plot faceted by categorical levels. You can use seaborn's [`swarmplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.swarmplot.html) function to add a swarm plot to any other plot. The `inner = \"stick\"` and `inner = \"point\"` options can also be used with the `violinplot` function to include a swarm plot inside of the violin areas, instead of a box plot.\n",
